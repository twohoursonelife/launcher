--- CONVERT RESOURCES.QRC TO RESOURCES_RC.PY ---
Qt Designer accesses any images and creates a *.qrc file.
It stores the image directory path and the alias.
This makes relocating and changing images a bit easier.
Once you have set up resources in Qt Designer, a *.qrc file will be created.
The *.qrc file can have any name you want, as long as
the converted *.py has the same same, plus _rc.
So resources.qrc needs to be named resources_rc.py.
Otherwise you get an error.
>>>	pyrcc5 resources.qrc -o resources_rc.py
• "-o" stands for output


--- CONVERT *.UI FILE TO *.PY FILE ---
Qt Designer uses *.ui files to store the designed GUI.
To be able to use it for python, open the CMD/Terminal and type:
>>>	pyuic5 -x sample.ui -o samply.py
• "-o" stands for output
• "-x" 


--- CONVERT *.PY FILE TO ONE *.EXE FILE ---
>>>	pyinstaller --onefile -w sample.py
• "--onefile" to save the program in one single *.exe
• "-w" to deactivate the CMD/terminal appearing
